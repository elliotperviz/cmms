#Definition of the unit cell
acell 15 15 15    # The keyword "acell" refers to the

       0 1 0

#Definition of the atom types
ntypat 2          # There is only one type of atom
znucl 8 1           # The keyword "znucl" refers to the atomic number of the 
                  # possible type(s) of atom. The pseudopotential(s) 
                  # mentioned in the "files" file must correspond
