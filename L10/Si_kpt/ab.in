#Definition of the atom types

znucl 14          # The keyword "znucl" refers to the atomic number of the 
                  # possible type(s) of atom. The pseudopotential(s) 
                  # mentioned in the "files" file must correspond
                  # to the type(s) of atom. Here, the only type is Silicon.
