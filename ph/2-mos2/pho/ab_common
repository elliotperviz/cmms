#Definition of the planewave basis set

#Definition of the k-point grid
kptopt 0          # Enter the k points manually 
nkpt 1            # Only one k point is needed for isolated system,
                  # taken by default to be 0.0 0.0 0.0

#Definition of the SCF procedure
nstep 100         # Maximal number of SCF cycles
toldfe 1.0d-9     # Will stop when, twice in a row, the difference
                  # between two consecutive evaluations of total energy
                  # differ by less than toldfe (in Hartree)
                  # This value is way too large for most realistic studies of materials
diemac 12.0       # Although this is not mandatory, it is worth to
                  # precondition the SCF cycle. The model dielectric
                  # function used as the standard preconditioner
                  # is described in the "dielng" input variable section.
                  # Here, we follow the prescriptions for molecules
