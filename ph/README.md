# Phonons - Harmonic Approximation

## Tutorial Outline

1) [Phonon band structure of the isolated H<sub>2</sub>O molecule](1-h2o/)
2) [Phonon band structure of crystalline bilayer MoS<sub>2</sub>](2-mos2/)

Short paragraph(s):

## Introduction

- Introduction to phonon method, don't write out full theory here but summarise, and point reader to lecture notes for full detail.

- What is phonopy (implements finite displacement method upto 2nd order)

- We calculate our forces via ab initio method (Abinit) but in principle we could also perform the necessary calculations with LAMMPS (we can interface different softwares with phonopy)
