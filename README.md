# Computational Methods for Materials Science
Here you will find lecture and tutorial material for the course **Computational Methods for Materials Science**.

Written and maintained by<br>
- Prof. Antonio Cammarata (cammaant@fel.cvut.cz)<br>
- MSc. Elliot Perviz (perviell@fel.cvut.cz)<br>

## Installation (software and tutorial material)

In the laboratory sessions, the machines are prepared to have all relevant software pre-installed. The **only requirement** is to clone this github repository to download the prepared input files. Use the following commands in the location where you would like to download the files:

```bash
mkdir cmms<br>
cd cmms<br>
git clone https://github.com/elliotperviz/cmms.git<br>
```

For your reference, we provide a list of the relevant software used throughout the tutorials below:

Additional scripts may be required for post-processing and analysis that we have prepared for the laboratory sessions, which are found in the scripts folder. Some scripts may require compilation from source - relevant instruction to do this can be found in the scripts folder.

For installation on your home computer, please check the relevant installation guides for the different software packages. [In the future, we may provide short installation guides here for different types of machine]
